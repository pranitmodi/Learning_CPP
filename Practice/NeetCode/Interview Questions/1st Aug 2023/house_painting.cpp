// The city of Hackerland can be represented with an even number n houses arranged in a row. A painter must paint the houses using at most three colors. The following conditions must hold true:
// 1. No two adjacent houses are the same color.
// 2. The houses which are at the same distance from both ends must not be colored with the same color.
// For example, n=6 then houses will be [1,2,3,4,5,6], so the houses at the same distance from both the ends will be [1,6], [2,5], [3,4].
// The task is to find the number of ways to paint the houses using at most three colors such that both the above conditions hold true.

// I was thinking of using => Recursion + Stack

// Its a DP Question
