Static (Stack memory) - Compile time => Arrays, fixed size is allocated at initialization.
Dynamic Memory Allocation (Heap memory) - Runtime => Vectors falls into this, as size can be changed.

Whenever push_back() is done, size of the vector gets doubled.
-> This is done by making a new vector of double the size and copying the elements to that vector.
