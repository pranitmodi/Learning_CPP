AND -> & -> (.) operator
OR -> | -> (+) operator
NOT -> ~ -> takes 1's compliment
XOR -> ^
    -> 1 for odd number of 1's
    -> 0 for even number of 1's
    -> a^a = 0
    -> a^0 = a
    -> Question: Subarray of a given XOR k

For printing ~a -> it takes 2's compliment as MSB is 1, and thus prints a negative number.

Left Shift -> eg: 5<<1 -> (multiply by 2)
           -> for big numbers, this might create a negative number, if MSB becomes 1.

Right Shift -> eg: 5>>2 -> (division by 2)
            -> padding always happens with 0 for positive numbers.
