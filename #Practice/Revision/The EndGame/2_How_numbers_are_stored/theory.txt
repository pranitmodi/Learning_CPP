Positive Numbers - just convert decimal to binary
Negative Numbers    
    - Convert decimal to binary
    - Take 2's compliment (1's compliment and then add one bit to the Last Bit(least significant bit))

Now, the leftmost bit (Most significant bit) tells us whether the number is positive or negative,
    - if it is 1 - negative number, then take 2's compliment and then convert to decimal 
        and assign a negative sign to the decimal.
    - if it is 0 - positive number, then just convert to decimal.

int range after 2's compliment was implimented to ignore -0 -> -2^31 to (2^31)-1.

8 bytes = 32 bits
2^32 total combinations
half for negative and non-negative - 2^31 each
since we start non-negative by 0, 
    thus it takes space of one of the integers and hence one less in range.
